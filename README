1. What is PureUserAdmin?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PureUserAdmin is a webbased tool written in PHP4 to manage a 
MySQL/PostgreSQL/PureDB database that holds ftp only accounts.

2. (New) Features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

List of current features (new features marked with *) :
 
Listing ftp accounts
Adding ftp accounts
Modifying ftp accounts
Deleting ftp accounts
Check access rights on homedir
Notify users with their ftp info
PHP5 support
Search and pages in userlist*

3. Requirements.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PureUserAdmin requires :
  
    * A http server
    * PHP5, with mysql.so/psql.so module (or build in support).
    * MySQL/PostgreSQL daemon.
		* PureFTPd with mysql/postgresql auth config
		* A webbrowser
  
Supported browsers are:
  
    * Mozilla 
    * Netscape 6.x+
    * IE 5.x (and higher)
    * Opera 6.0+
    * Lynx
  
4. Installation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just unpack it somewhere in your www root.
Edit index.php to reflect your system.

5. Project goals.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main goal is:
	* to make a webbased application that every ftp-server 
		admin can use to manage the users in the MySQL database.
	* to make a webbased application that every ftp-user can
		use to change their ftp password

When the main goal is reached it would be nice to make a directory
creation/checking function (checking realized in 0.0.2) so a new 
user will have it's homedir setup or the program will display an 
error when the homedir is already there and the new user 
doesn't have permissions there.
  
6. For administrators.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This section is intended for system administrators who would like to 
  offer PureUserAdmin to the users on their systems. 

7. Security.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Run it over SSL ONLY!
* Do not run your webserver as user nobody!
* Don't forget to restrict access with .htaccess/.htpasswd
  
Also read the beautiful NO WARRANTY disclaimer in the GPL. ;)
