1. Add some username detection ($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']?) in which maps someone onto a particular customer
 e.g. crownford / floorplanz / admins


2. Add company field to users table - which is an arbitrary string.

3. Update UI to filter by appropriate company

4. Admins should be able to see all users

5. Non-Admins can only see users belonging to their company

6. Should we add something to $config to anchor a customer within a particular area e.g. 'floorplanz' => '/srv/floorplanz' etc.

7. Setup SSL certificate (free one, or snakeoil one? (rapidssl or whoever?))
